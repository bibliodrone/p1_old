Sub-domain (remote) setup steps, from Jannette on CSci E15 Piazza

Test SSH key for GitHub
$ssh - T git@github.com
(If I get "Hi Jannette" I am good)

STEP 1 - Make sure I have a p1 folder created at my local machine  htdocs
In cmder, navigate to c:\xampp\htdocs\p1
$git init 
(this is to identify my folder as a local git repository)

STEP 2 - View hidden files
$ls -la
(if I see a .git in blue, that means my local folder is configured for git)

STEP 3 
$git status
(to test folder)

STEP 4 - Chooose files that I want to push to GitHub.com
$ git add README.md
$ git add index.html
	OR 
$ git add --all

STEP 5 - Document the changes to the files
git commit -m "Updating README.md, correcting index.html"

STEP 6 - Go to GitHub.com, via GUI, craete a new repository
(ONE TIME TASK for the specific folder) 
Repository name: p1 Description: Project 1 for CSCI E-15

STEP 7 - Connect folder/repository on local machine to GitHub
(ONE TIME TASK for the specific folder)
To run this, in cmder I should be inside of the specific folder, example, inside of c:\xampp\htdocs\p1
$git remote add origin git@github.com:JannetteA/p1.git
(this uses the SSH patch to the repository in GitHub)

STEP 8 - Double-check remotes I have now
$git remote --v

STEP 9 - Push files to GitHub
$git push origin master

STEP 10 - Connect to Digital Ocean (youc an open another console in cmder)
$ ssh root@99.99.99.99 
(use your IP address)

(ONE TIME TASK)
cd /var
cd www
cd html 
~# git clone git@github.com:JannetteA/p1.git

STEP 12 - Make sure you are at in Digital Ocean, under p1 folder:
/var/www/html/p1#
